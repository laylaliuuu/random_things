  <p>While the STEM field is still a male-dominated world and is the future trend, it is important and necessary for females to be part of this career. It would be one step closer to achieving gender equality of all sorts. <br> <br></p>

<p>The skills we learn from STEM class will develop our critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and these skills will help our future career or even life skill in many ways.</p>

  <p>As a student in an all-girl school, gender equality is something we often talk about. Females are likely to face inequality in the working world. As the next generation, we want to change this by proving our ability, especially in a male-dominated field like STEM. </p> <br><br>

  <p>As people have preconceptions about which gender would be more good at Math and Science, it is important for me to prove that girls are not less than boys. </p>
