    <h1 class="title">What prepared me (CMU)</h1>
    <h4 class="date">July 26, 2019</h4>
    <p class="class="blog-content">At the age of fourteen, I was first exposed to American culture. The words scared and insecure were simply not enough to describe the tremendous stress I was undergoing. Looking back on my arrival in the US, I was so timid and anxious about meeting new people or culturally offending others. However, throughout the years, I have built up self-confidence in academics and life, while gradually adapting to the American culture, and progressively finding my path. This journey includes defeating my fear and taking the initiative persistently.  
 	I recall my first Spanish class. Everyone was enthusiastically introducing themselves, but with my very limited English skills, I felt isolated because I could barely keep up with the conversation. To rub more salt in the wound, we played an icebreaker game where whoever gets the ball needed to introduce themselves in Spanish. Sadly, I did not even know when someone was speaking English or Spanish. I tried to pretend I was composed, but my trembling body exposed me. When the ball came to me, looking around the room, I was met with blank stares. My quivering lips did not allow me to say any words, not even my name. That was the longest thirty seconds I have ever experienced. 
	As a girl who always considers herself outstanding, this incident devastated me. I constantly sought extra help from my teachers during their office hours. Watching YouTube videos became my new way of self-learning. Burning the midnight oil was the only option for me to keep up with the class. I am proud to say that all my hard work paid off with my excellent grades in all my classes. The sense of achievement motivates me to reach higher and to take more rigorous courses at Notre Dame Academy.  
 	The confidence and communication skills that I have developed from my academic experience and leadership as Class President at Notre Dame Academy for the past two years, enabled me to confront any challenge. In a way, I could describe myself as hungry for learning. Always pushing myself beyond the limit and satisfying my curiosity brings a sense of excitement and adventure to my life. This rigorous summer program at Carnegie Mellon University would be my next “stepping out of my comfort zone” challenge. I know that my curiosity, perseverance, and determination would lead me to be an asset to the program and to find personal success.
